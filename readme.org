#+TITLE: Flat keyboard
I want the flattest possible keyboard with mechanical switches. At the moment I'm trying to build it with Kailh Choc V1, however I'm also considering Kailh X in the future.

Because flatness is my #1 goal, I can't use PCB for this design, since it adds few milimeters of height (PCB itself is ~1mm, but also the keycap sits on top of it, instead of inside it, and that wastes around 3-4mm).

Because there is no PCB, the keyboard will have to be handwired.

My microcontoller of choice is nrfMicro by joric.

My firmware of choice is ZMK.


*** Version (keyswitch housing V2) notes:

- test = 6 would be fun, but, there is no way to plug the swithc all the way down AND put a keycap on it so it doesn't wobble (aka goes all the way down into keyswitch). One more idea to test, is to actually make also a hole for keycap, will test in V3
- test = 3 stops 0.1 before hitting the plate. Because it doesn't bottom out, the sound is a little bit different than the rest (higher pitch)
- bottom-out sound on test 6,5,4 is thicker, lower pitch, kinda like typing on typing machine. It has it's appeal
