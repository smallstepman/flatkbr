#+TITLE: Flat keyboard
I want the flattest possible keyboard with mechanical switches. At the moment I'm trying to build it with Kailh Choc V1, however I'm also considering Kailh X in the future.

Because flatness is my #1 goal, I can't use PCB for this design, since it adds few milimeters of height (PCB itself is ~1mm, but also the keycap sits on top of it, instead of inside it, and that wastes around 3-4mm).

Because there is no PCB, the keyboard will have to be handwired.

My microcontoller of choice is nrfMicro by joric.

My firmware of choice is ZMK.


*** Version (keyswitch housing V3) notes:

11mm measuring from the top of the keycap to the bottom of the base. Maaaybe I can go 10.5, but I'm not really sure if I'd be able to actually run the wires and solder it to sit flat.
For the moment I'm happy.

Now I need to work on placement
